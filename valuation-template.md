# Valuation Template (Working Draft)

## Step 1: Classify The Business
Answer these before choosing any valuation method.
- What do they sell that people need now?
- Profit stability: stable / cyclical / volatile
- Capital structure: net cash / neutral / net debt
- Cash flow stability: steady / lumpy (working capital, capex swings)
- Reinvestment needs: low / medium / high

## Step 2: Choose Primary Valuation Lens
- Stable + net debt -> EV/EBIT (adjusted)
- Stable + low debt -> P/E + FCF yield
- Cyclical -> Normalized EV/EBIT across cycle
- Early growth / low profit -> P/S + FCF trend
- Commodity -> EV/EBITDA + cycle adjustment

## Step 3: Quick Quality Checks
- One-off items removed from EBIT
- Working capital swings normalized
- Check if amortization distorts EBIT (consider EBITA)
- Balance sheet risk (debt maturity, covenant risk)

## Step 4: Interpret Multiples (0–12 months)
- Is today’s multiple higher/lower than recent history?
- Is profit trend improving or deteriorating?
- Is cash conversion consistent?

## Step 5: Decision (0–12 months)
- If multiple high and profit trend weak -> avoid
- If multiple reasonable and profit trend improving -> consider
- If multiple low but profit collapsing -> avoid

## Notes
- Keep assumptions explicit and dated.
- Prefer R12 / TTM data over single quarter.
