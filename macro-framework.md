# Macro Framework — Signal to Confirmation (Working Draft)

## Goal
Capture directional shifts early, then confirm with hard data. Use 3‑month direction to filter noise.

## Order (Signal → Confirmation)
1) Central Bank (policy rate + path)
2) Currency (e.g., EUR/SEK)
3) Inflation (KPIF + KPIF ex energy; CPI as complement)
4) External Cycle (Germany/Euro area via IFO/PMI)
5) Domestic Soft Data (PMI, NIER Konjunkturbarometer)
6) Housing & Credit (transmission of policy)
7) Labor Market (SCB AKU) — confirmation
8) Hard Data (retail, industrial production, GDP/GDP indicator)

## Reading Rule
- Focus on direction over the last ~3 months.
- Treat single-month prints as noise unless confirmed by other blocks.

## Output (Simple Label)
- Går starkt
- Ser bra ut
- Neutral / saktar till
- Oroligt
- Dåligt

## Notes
- Always record dates for each data point.
- If blocks conflict, prioritize earlier signals but wait for confirmation.
